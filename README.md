# Hospitality Analysis for AtliQ Grands
## Project Overview
Welcome to my latest Power BI project focused on the **Hospitality Analysis for AtliQ Grands!** 🏨

AtliQ Grands, a renowned chain with over 30 properties across India, faced significant challenges due to fierce competition from industry giants like Taj and Hyatt. To regain their market share and enhance decision-making, they sought data-driven insights.

## Project Goals
The primary objective was to empower AtliQ Grands with comprehensive insights from various channels, enabling smarter decisions, boosting revenue, and outperforming competitors. I developed three detailed dashboards to achieve this:

### Dashboards

#### 1. Performance View
 ● Provides essential metrics and dynamic visuals.  
 ● Offers deep insights into hotel performance.  
 ● Stakeholders can easily identify top-performing channels and revenue trends.

#### 2. Booking Insights
● Delves into booking trends, cancellation rates, and room class distributions.  
● Uncovers hidden patterns, helping optimize strategies for maximum bookings and revenue.

#### 3. Executive View
● Designed for top-level executives.  
● Offers a bird's-eye view of critical metrics like revenue, occupancy percentage, and ADR (Average Daily Rate).  
● Quick access to these insights ensures informed decision-making at every level.

## Key Insights & Recommendations
● **Pricing Strategy:** There is minimal difference in ADR between weekdays and weekends, indicating a need for a more dynamic pricing strategy to maximize revenue.  
● **Booking Platforms:** Direct offline booking platforms have the highest realization percentage and ADR, suggesting a focus on enhancing these channels.  
● **Occupancy & Ratings:** A strong correlation exists between occupancy, ratings, and cancellations, highlighting the importance of maintaining high ratings, especially on online platforms.  
● **Revenue Trends:** Luxury hotels and elite room types generate the highest revenue, with Mumbai being the top-performing city.

## Metrics Explained
● **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** Assesses a hotel's financial performance by calculating the revenue generated per room available for sale.  
● **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Calculates the average price or rate at which hotel rooms are sold on a given day.  
● **SRS (Sellable Room Nights):** Represents the number of room nights a hotel can sell as part of its strategic revenue management approach.  
● **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** Helps identify specific issues like room blocking or maintenance.  
● **Realization:** Calculated as URN (Utilized Room Nights) divided by BRN (Booked Room Nights), where BRN includes URN, no-shows, and cancellations.
